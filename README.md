[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/s3.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/s3-repo)

S3-repo is an alternative/cheaper solution to private repositories. For the cases where you wish to share a set of npm packages across a set of projects and you have access to AWS S3, S3-repo provides a set of tools to allow you to publish packages to S3 and install directly from S3.

```
npm install --save-dev s3-repo
```
